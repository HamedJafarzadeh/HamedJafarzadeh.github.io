RF, acoustic and optical communication links are the commonly used methods of underwater\n        communications. However, the conductivity of water can cause severe attenuation and absorption to the RF\n        signals. To\n        tackle this issue, high power transmitter and large antenna size are required, which is not suitable for most\n        aquaculture monitoring applications. Optical communications need a clear line of sight, and acoustic\n        communication\n        suffers from limited bandwidth, propagation delay, and multipath effect.
