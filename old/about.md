I'm a Computer & Electronics Engineering student. Currently, I'm studying Information science and Technology at [Skoltech](www.skoltech.ru) ( Skolkovo Institute of science and technology ).

I have more than 8 years of software and hardware programming experience in industries and academic projects. I was very excited about computers since my childhood and with support of my family I was able to work freely in my leisure time with computer and soon, at age of 15 (2010), I made my first official software product named “Clinic” which was used by dentists for keeping the patient's records.  

Afterwards I decided to build some applications to interact with real world, This was the point where I find out about robotics and I started to develop microcontroller based devices and it turned out to be my major in future. Now I have several awards and many successful projects in robotics with couple of publications and inventions supporting it. 

**The most noticeable thing about my success in life is I have always loved what I’ve done till now.**
